# Single-Track Vehicle Models
A series of vehicle dynamics model, commonly used in model-based control. The project includes the 2-DOF, and two types of 3-DOF vehicle models

All of the models are single track models.

Including: 

2-DOF vehicle lateral dynamic model that considers the lateral movement and yaw movement of the vehicle

3-DOF model that considers the lateral, yaw, and roll motion

3-DOF model that considers the longitudinal, lateral, and yaw motion


Vertical vehicle dynamics model is outside the scope of this project.
