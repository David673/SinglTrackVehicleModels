# SinglTrackVehicleModels
A series of vehicle dynamics model, commonly used in model-based control.

All of the models are single track models.

Including: 

    2-DOF vehicle lateral dynamic model that considers the lateral movement and yaw movement of the vehicle

    3-DOF model that considers the lateral, yaw, and roll motion

    3-DOF model that considers the longitudinal, lateral, and yaw motion

    4-DOF model that considers the longi., lat., yaw and roll motion


Vertical vehicle dynamics model is outside the scope of this project.
